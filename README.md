### JavaScript Array Methods
- find() - Return the first element in an array that matches a test you provide
- map() - apply a given function to every item in your array and return a new array with those values
- filter() - takes your array and removes items that don't pass a test you give it
- reduce() - most flexible array iterator, processes each item of the array and lets you modify a value as you go
- concat() - adds new items to the end of your array
- flatMap() - pass a function that returns an array and it will squish all the results together into a flat array
- join() - insert a given string between each item, and return a joined up string
- every() - checks that every single item in your array matches some criteria
- some() - checks that at least one item in your array matches some criteria
- includes() - checks that at least one item in your array matches some criteria 
- forEach() - applies a given function to every element in the array. Doesn't return a value
